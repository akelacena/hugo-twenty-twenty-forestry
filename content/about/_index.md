I love gaming, I love streaming, I love my community 🤙 I'm Portuguese, I'm a father 👨‍👧 and 41 years old. PC is my platform (YES I play with a 🖱). FPS is my genre, be it Battle Royale, Multiplayer, Cooperative or even Story mode. 💣

I started playing games in the late 80s in a PC, also on the original Nintendo and Sega consoles. In the late 90s I focussed on Unreal Tournament and really loved it. I managed to get into the top 10 in Europe, but afterwards settled in the top 20. Also had the 2nd biggest kill streak, a 43 kill streak.

In 2001 came University, the state of gaming industry and status wasn't as nowadays, so studies took over most of my time and focus. I have been fortunate enough to have been in several areas in my professional life, being a Sales Person, Audio Producer, Music Creator, IT Engineer and even a Airplane Student Pilot. Without a doubt my biggest blessing was the birth of my daughter.

So, for 15+ years I had no PC to game and just a few random incursions on consoles with friends. In 2018 I built my PC. Don't get me wrong, I built more PCs than I can count in my lifetime, but this was a comeback. One of the parts came with a 1-year license for a streaming software and believe it or not that's how I got into streaming, with no aware of state the gaming industry at the time.

During this streaming experience I got to know a lot of people, some of which I am proud to call as friends. As things progressed naturally a community was created by us, united in a discord server called "Buddies". This community strives to be mature and friendly, all are welcome and enticed to follow those guidelines.
