PUBG is hardly moving people as once it did and to me it is no diferent. The choices the studio and develepors have been making are constantly changing the game but not towards the interest of hardcore gamers and mainstream community. Reoccuring problems and longtime no solution problems seem to dominate the game. This persistance quite frankly has got most people fed up. Tolerance is at a whoping 0!

Apex Legends is hardly a new comer, but it has matured and some features despite lacking the game is rock solid. The speed of movement and of occuring events is fantastic and drives the community. Still waiting on that anti-cheat and audio fix, which does seem to be a reocurring one. Lets see how removing the tap-strafe movement from within the game will alter the direction at which the game will flow...
